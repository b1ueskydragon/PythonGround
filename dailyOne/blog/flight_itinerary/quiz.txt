Given an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as (origin, destination) pairs,
and a starting airport, compute the person's itinerary.

If no such itinerary exists, return null.
All flights must be used in the itinerary.

For example, given the following list of flights:

HNL ➔ AKL
YUL ➔ ORD
ORD ➔ SFO
SFO ➔ HNL

and starting airport YUL, you should return YUL ➔ ORD ➔ SFO ➔ HNL ➔ AKL.

it's possible to have a cycle in the graph.

hint: solve with backtracking
