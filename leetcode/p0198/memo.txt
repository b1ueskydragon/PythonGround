Let's make a formula for make the problem simple.

nums = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6]
Index i start with 1. Each num is bigger than 0.

i=6 (curr=a6)
includes_curr := a6 + exclude_previous

exclude_previous :=    a1 + a3   --- x  or
                       a1 + a4   --- y  or
                       a2 + a4   --- z

x is the exclude_previous from curr=a5 (need to remember at the previous point, a5)
y or z is the include_previous from curr=a5 (need to determine which one is bigger at the previous point, a5)
In any case, Those should be determined at the previous stage.
