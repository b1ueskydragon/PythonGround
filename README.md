### Application of basic ~ intermidiate algorithms and data structures
also test codes.<br>
```
/leetcode, /dailyOne, /graffity, /retrospective
```
### To build a base of machine learning
basic concept of linear algebra and regressions.<br>
```
/math
```

I recognize that there are a number of messy codes🐊 and files and dirs of my early days, also the classify of directories are untidy 😉<br>
I hope to clean up and refactor some day. Separate Repos and rename dirs maybe occurs, up too my mood.
